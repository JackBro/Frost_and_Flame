The value to set should be identical to the language files name, excluding the ".txt". 
ie. for "english.txt" set Language = english in the config file.
Please note that language files have to be save in UTF-8 format, else they may fail to function correctly.

Known bugs
----------
As this is still a work in progress, the format of the savegames may, and does change quite often.
It is recommended you either overwrite your older savegames with new ones, or delete the older ones when upgrading to a newer version of Frost and Flame.
Or better still remove the older version of the game completely, before installing a newer version.
If the game fails to load, try deleting the Fraost_And_Flame.cfg file, it may be caused by recent improvements to the game.
