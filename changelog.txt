Due to university, work and the responsibilities of life,
I feel that Frost and Flame has been coming on very slowly these past few months.
It may be slow at the moment, but I am determined to complete this game,
it may take longer than I had first anticipated.
These are not indications that the project will be terminated in the future,
just that time is not permitting to proceed at a fast pace, at the moment.
